# Coinbase data visualizer
This project is useful for visualising data in ways that are not available on coinbase. A main feature that is in my opinion quite useful, is to directly compare all your currencies' rate of change in the same graph, such that you can review which one is doing best, and more! 

You will have to install a couple libraries if you don't have them already;
installing cbpro: simply type "pip install cbpro" in cmd,
installing matplotlib: "pip install matplotlib" in cmd
installing seaborn: "pip install seaborn" in cmd

You will also have to create two empty text files, they have to have the names "values2.txt." and "myCrypto.txt" respectively, if you would rather have them be named something else, simply find all the instances of the names, and change them with your preferred name!

This project is still in progress.
